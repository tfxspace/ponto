### ðŸŽˆponto. - time tracking and attendance management
ponto is a very simple web app for time tracking and attendance management. users can punch in/out with a button, and view their history in a table. built with bootstrap, css, php, and mysql. requires php/mysql environment.
I was looking for something extremely simple and easy to implement.

1. import ponto.sql into your database
2. change the connections.php configuration according to actual configuration, to make sure the connection to the database is done
