### ðŸŽˆponto. - time tracking and attendance management
ponto is a ridiculously simple web app for time tracking and attendance management. users can punch in/out with a button, and view their history in a table. built with bootstrap, css, php, and mysql. requires php and mysql environment.
The data gathered could be used to generate reports, something I'll do in the future.
